# User Experience Flow: AI-Agent × Gelato System

## 🎯 **The Complete User Journey** (60 seconds from upload to live products)

## **🔧 Technical Note: Fixed Variant Strategy**

**Why Fixed Sizes?**
- **Predictable inventory** → Always know what products you'll have
- **Consistent pricing** → No AI making arbitrary pricing decisions  
- **Simplified logistics** → Standard sizes work with all artwork types
- **Faster processing** → No complex AI analysis of "optimal" dimensions

**Fixed Variant Matrix:**
```
Small (A4)     × Premium Paper = Product 1
Small (A4)     × Canvas        = Product 2  
Small (A4)     × Framed        = Product 3
Medium (50×70) × Premium Paper = Product 4
Medium (50×70) × Canvas        = Product 5
Medium (50×70) × Framed        = Product 6
Large (70×100) × Premium Paper = Product 7
Large (70×100) × Canvas        = Product 8
Large (70×100) × Framed        = Product 9
```

**AI's Role (Limited & Focused):**
- ✅ Generate product titles and descriptions
- ✅ Create Gelato API payloads for fixed variants
- ✅ Validate image quality and format
- ❌ Does NOT choose sizes or materials
- ❌ Does NOT make pricing decisions beyond fixed markup
